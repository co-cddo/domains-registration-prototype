### Requirements
Node.js LTS version 20.x.x

### How to install and run it locally
1. Clone local repository and download ZIP
2. Move the unzipped folder to a local path at your choice (e.g. prototypes)
3. Open terminal 
4. Navigate into that folder via: `cd ~/Documents/prototypes/domains-registration-prototype-main`
 - or replace 'domains-registration-prototype-main' with the name of your prototype folder
5. In the terminal, enter: `npm run dev`
 - The first time you `run npm run dev`, the kit will ask you whether you want to send anonymous data to help the team improve the service. Enter y or n to answer yes or no.
6. In your web browser, go to open http://localhost:3000 (opens in a new tab).
