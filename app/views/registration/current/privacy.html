      </h2>
      <p>
        The Cyber and Domains Protection team at the Government Digital Services (GDS) is responsible for approving all .gov.uk domain names on behalf of the Cabinet Office.
      </p>
      <p>The Get approval to use a .gov.uk domain name is a service that lets eligible public sector organisations apply to use a .gov.uk domain name.</p>
        <p>There are three parties involved in the registration of a .gov.uk domain name:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>Registrants who wish to apply for a domain name are data controllers.</li>
          <li>The .gov.uk Approved Registrars who submit domain applications on behalf of registrants are data processors.</li>
          <li>GDS, which processes applications and is a data controller.
          </li>
        </ul>
