          <li>We will contact you within 5 working days to confirm approval, reject the application or to ask for more information.</li>

        <p>If the Domains Team rejects an application you can appeal on behalf of your registrant by emailing <code class="govspeak-code">appeals@domains.gov.uk</code>. <br><br>
          We will forward this appeal with any additional information we request or your registrant wants to provide to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/naming-and-approvals-committee-nac" class="govuk-link">Naming and Approvals Committee (NAC)</a> and keep you up-to-date with progress.
        </p>
      <p>The NAC will make a final decision and will give its reasoning.</p>
