        Moving your parish council to a .gov.uk domain
    </h2>
      
      <p>This guide is for parish council clerks who want to set up or move their council to a .gov.uk domain. </p>
      <p>A domain is a unique address on the internet. All internet-based services such as websites, emails, video calling, document storage and mapping services need a domain to work. 
      </p>
      <p>Every domain is designed for a specific use. For example, there are many domains in use including:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>.com for businesses</li>
        <li>.co.uk for UK businesses</li>
        <li>.org or .org.uk for non-profit organisations</li>
        <li>.info for educational and informational purposes</li>
        <li>.net.uk for internet service providers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many parish councils wrongly use one of the above or similar domains for their websites instead of a .gov.uk domain, which was specifically created for use by central, devolved and local UK public sector organisations.</p>
      <p>Almost all councils have also used free email services at some point, which is not recommended. Free email accounts do not look professional and some providers use email scanning for ad personalisation in exchange for providing services for free. These email accounts are also in control of the individuals using them and not under the control of the council.</p>
      <p>CDDO recommends using .gov.uk domains for both council websites and emails. </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      The benefits of a gov.uk domain for parish councils
    </h3>
    <p>Parish councils can get the benefits of using a gov.uk domain including having:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the trusted .gov.uk brand that people will recognise</li>
      <li>improved rankings in search engines</li>
      <li>continuous central government monitoring for potential security vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>the ability to better control email accounts by removing staff when they leave</li>
      <li>better legal protection because it's based in a UK jurisdiction</li>
      <li>increased transparency and security compared to personal email accounts </li>
    </ul>

      Get help from the Parish Council Domain Helper Service
    </h4>
    <p>If applying for a .gov.uk domain is new to you, the Parish Council Domains Helper Service can help you through the process step-by-step. You can email <a href="mailto:parish-helper@domains.gov.uk" class="govuk-link--no-visited-state">parish-helper@domains.gov.uk</a> to get started. </p>
    <p>This service offers: </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>workshops to help build your knowledge so you can move to a .gov.uk domain</li>
        <li>information about your role in securing the domain name as the registrant</li>
        <li>how to maintain best working practices for the future</li>
        <li>information about available funding! Councils can receive a £100 plus VAT discount for the first year when they move to a .gov.uk domain during the 2024 to 2025 financial year. If you already have a gov.uk domain, you can use the funding to move to a .gov.uk website or use .gov.uk email addresses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be eligible for this financial support, councils must use one of the .gov.uk Approved Registrars that are part of the Parish Council Domains Helper Service. 
      </p>
    <h5 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Check the services you need
    </h5>
    <p>When you understand the services you need, you can plan your budget and take advantage of the financial support available. This will help your council make a smooth and cost-effective move to a .gov.uk domain.

<h6 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Your role as domain registrant
</h6>
<p>As the clerk of the council you will apply for the domain as the registrant. This role means you are accountable for the .gov.uk domain. 
</p>
<p>Being the registrant means you must make sure that any changes to the .gov.uk domain name and website are properly managed and approved. This means you will have control over the domain name and all related services, such as emails and the website. </p>
<p>The registrant is accountable for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>contacting a registrar to apply for and manage the domain name</li>
  <li>overseeing and approving any modifications to the domain name</li>
  <li>managing email accounts and the website</li>
  <li>making sure the domain and its use comply with relevant guidelines and policies</li>
  <li>.net.uk for internet service providers</li>
</ul>
<p>By appointing you as registrant, your parish council is making sure that domain management is in capable hands and has a central point of responsibility and control. </p>



<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
Choosing a .gov.uk Approved Registrar for your parish council
</h2>

<p>When your parish council has agreed to move to a gov.uk domain, you can start to look for a supplier who will register your new .gov.uk domain name. They are known as .gov.uk Approved Registrars. 
</p>
<p>We have created a shortlist of .gov.uk Approved Registrars who have agreed to provide additional support to parish councils. When you choose one of the .gov.uk Approved Registrars from this shortlist, you can expect:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>helpful support in non-technical language</li>
  <li>the safe movement of your existing services to your new domain </li>
  <li>the forwarding of emails to your new domain</li>
  <li>a technical point of contact to address and promptly resolve problems</li>
  <li>a contact number for telephone support </li>
  <li>minimal disruption during the set up of your new domain and services</li>
  <li>ongoing help so that your council complies with the 2024 JPAG Practitioners Guide</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
  Tips for selecting your .gov.uk Approved Registrar
</h2>
<p>You will have a long-term working relationship with the Approved Registrar so it's important you feel you are comfortable communicating with them. </p>
<p>It can be as simple as feeling that they use language you easily understand and they have taken the time to reassure you and answer your questions.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
  Check more than just the cost
</h3>
  <p>Do not focus solely on cost. Make sure that the Approved Registrar you are considering can actually provide the services, security, and support your council needs.</p>      
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
    Look for value in bundles
  </h3>
    <p>Registrars sometimes offer to ‘bundle’ services together at a reduced price.</p>
    <p>Ask the .gov.uk Approved Registrars if they offer service bundles that could be good value for your council. </p>
    <p>Do make sure any bundle you choose to buy includes only the services your council needs, or you could end up paying for something you do not use.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Pick three registrars to get quotes from
    </h3>
      <p>Look through the shortlist of .gov.uk Approved Registrars to find one that suits your council’s needs. Before you approach an Approved Registrar prepare questions about the services you need and any costs. You could ask the following:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>What bundles do you provide and how much will it cost yearly?</li>
        <li>What methods of support do you offer?</li>
        <li>I would like to keep my existing website and move it to .gov.uk - what is involved?</li>
        <li>Will you help me create an accessibility statement for my existing website?</li>
        <li>Will you help get councillors and other staff set up with their email?</li>
        <li>Will you fix technical issues on my behalf?</li>
        <li>Will you help me renew my existing domain name to keep it safe?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Get help from the Parish Council Domains Helper Service</h3>
      <p>If you are unsure about what your chosen registrar has suggested to you, you can email <a href="mailto:parish-helper@domains.gov.uk" class="govuk-link--no-visited-state">parish-helper@domains.gov.uk</a> to help you check if it suits your council’s needs.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Approved Registrar shortlist for parish councils
    </h2>
    <p>You must select one of the following suppliers to get the £100 plus VAT funding to move to a .gov.uk domain name. Once you have chosen a registrar they will give you instructions on how to start the process.
    </p>
    <p>It is best practice to get 3 quotes before you select a registrar for your council. If you are not sure about who to choose, you can ask for recommendations from other parish councils or through forums such as the <a href="#" class="govuk-link--no-visited-state">Facebook Community Clerks' Network</a>.

      Your council's IT policy
    </h4>
    <p>It's good practice for your council to have an IT policy in place for when you start to use your .gov.uk domain. Everyone working for the council should be aware of and comply with the IT policy.</p>
    <p>Your IT policy can cover:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>acceptable use of IT resources including devices and software</li>
      <li>data management and security</li>
      <li>network and internet use</li>
      <li>appropriate use of email</li>
      <li>good practice account security including passwords</li>
      <li>staying secure when working with mobile devices and remotely</li>
      <li>how to report security incidents</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a class="govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#">Download this IT policy template</a>, which you can adapt for your parish council.</p>

    <h5 class="govuk-heading-m">
      What to do when your .gov.uk domain is live
    </h5>
    <p>It takes an average of 30 days to get set up with a .gov.uk domain when you apply to get the funding.</p>
    <p>Your .gov.uk Approved Registrar will usually manage the domain for you but it is good to familiarise yourself with how you are accountable for the .gov.uk domain name and what you can use it for.
    </p>
    <p><a class="govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#">Read our guidance on getting started with your .gov.uk domain</a> for more information.</p>

    <h5 class="govuk-heading-m">
