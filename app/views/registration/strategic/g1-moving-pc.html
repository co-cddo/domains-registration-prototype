        Moving your parish council to a .gov.uk domain
    </h2>
      
      <p>This guide is for parish council clerks who want to set up or move their council to a .gov.uk domain. </p>
      <p>A domain is a unique address on the internet. All internet-based services such as websites, emails, video calling, document storage and mapping services need a domain to work. 
      </p>
      <p>Every domain is designed for a specific use. For example, there are many domains in use including:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>.com for businesses</li>
        <li>.co.uk for UK businesses</li>
        <li>.org or .org.uk for non-profit organisations</li>
        <li>.info for educational and informational purposes</li>
        <li>.net.uk for internet service providers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many parish councils wrongly use one of the above or similar domains for their websites instead of a .gov.uk domain, which was specifically created for use by central, devolved and local UK public sector organisations.</p>
      <p>Almost all councils have also used free email services at some point, which is not recommended. Free email accounts do not look professional and some providers use email scanning for ad personalisation in exchange for providing services for free. These email accounts are also in control of the individuals using them and not under the control of the council.</p>
      <p>CDDO recommends using .gov.uk domains for both council websites and emails. </p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      The benefits of a gov.uk domain for parish councils
    </h3>
    <p>Parish councils can get the benefits of using a gov.uk domain including having:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the trusted .gov.uk brand that people will recognise</li>
      <li>improved rankings in search engines</li>
      <li>continuous central government monitoring for potential security vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>the ability to better control email accounts by removing staff when they leave</li>
      <li>better legal protection because it's based in a UK jurisdiction</li>
      <li>increased transparency and security compared to personal email accounts </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Get help from the Parish Council Domain Helper Service
    </h4>
    <p>If applying for a .gov.uk domain is new to you, the Parish Council Domains Helper Service can help you through the process step-by-step. You can email <a href="mailto:parish-helper@domains.gov.uk" class="govuk-link--no-visited-state">parish-helper@domains.gov.uk</a> to get started. </p>
    <p>This service offers: </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>workshops to help build your knowledge so you can move to a .gov.uk domain</li>
        <li>information about your role in securing the domain name as the registrant</li>
        <li>how to maintain best working practices for the future</li>
        <li>information about available funding! Councils can receive a Â£100 plus VAT discount for the first year when they move to a .gov.uk domain during the 2024 to 2025 financial year. If you already have a gov.uk domain, you can use the funding to move to a .gov.uk website or use .gov.uk email addresses.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To be eligible for this financial support, councils must use one of the .gov.uk Approved Registrars that are part of the Parish Council Domains Helper Service. 
      </p>
    <h5 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Check the services you need
    </h5>
    <p>When you understand the services you need, you can plan your budget and take advantage of the financial support available. This will help your council make a smooth and cost-effective move to a .gov.uk domain.

  Your role as domain registrant
</h6>
<p>As the clerk of the council you will apply for the domain as the registrant. This role means you are accountable for the .gov.uk domain. 
</p>
<p>Being the registrant means you must make sure that any changes to the .gov.uk domain name and website are properly managed and approved. This means you will have control over the domain name and all related services, such as emails and the website. </p>
<p>The registrant is accountable for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>contacting a registrar to apply for and manage the domain name</li>
  <li>overseeing and approving any modifications to the domain name</li>
  <li>managing email accounts and the website</li>
  <li>making sure the domain and its use comply with relevant guidelines and policies</li>
  <li>.net.uk for internet service providers</li>
</ul>
<p>By appointing you as registrant, your parish council is making sure that domain management is in capable hands and has a central point of responsibility and control. </p>
